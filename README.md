Tool to post pix and vid files to separate folders, with sub folders created based on the datestamp info of the files.

Video files are posted to yyyy-mm vid folders and pix to yyyy-mm pix folders

Does not overwrite any targets if they already exist.

Can also process zip archives, pulling out the files and posting them correctly.  This is ideal to cope with google photos downloads.
